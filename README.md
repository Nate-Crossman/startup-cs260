# Project Name: T.I.E.W.O.W (The Intense Epic War of Words)

[My Notes](notes.md)

TIEWOW is a Quiplash-inspired party game where players defeat their closest friends through the power of choosing "the best words" in response to a prompt of their own design.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

My application would allow users to create lobbies with various other users. Once in the lobby, a user can be selected or predetermined as the judge who expresses a prompt. The application would then ask other users that prompt and allow people to compare and vote for their favorite of the responses. It would be played in a manner similar to the party game 'Quiplash', but could also be used in other contexts, like education or as an icebreaker.

### Design

![Design image](startup_design.png)

### Key features

- Login Feature
- Create and Join Private Lobbies
- Third Party API can be used to help with example prompts or responses
- Prompt creation where a player can create a question for others to answer
- Voting period where players vote for the best prompt
- Point system to keep track of the player with the most votes

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Base framework of login page, private lobby pages, and 
- **CSS** - Create a fun design around the page to keep it visually interesting and have a party game aesthetic, but ensure readability is maintained for the best user experience.
- **React** - Use react to make the webpage interactable, such as buttons for submitting and joining a game.
- **Service** - Backend to process things like login data, lobbies, prompts, and votes. Third Party API's, such as [this fact generator](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/) will be implemented to hopefully inspire someone to come up with a prompt or response if they can't think of anything.
- **DB/Login** - Store login information, users, lobbies.
- **WebSocket** - Allow players to see the votes of other players for prompts, hopefully in real time.
